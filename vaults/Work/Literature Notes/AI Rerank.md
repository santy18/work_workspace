>[!note] Idea:

**Reranking** in AI refers to the process of taking an initial set of ranked results (e.g., search results, predictions, or recommendations) and applying additional techniques or models to reorder them based on refined criteria. The goal of reranking is to improve the quality or relevance of the output by applying more sophisticated evaluation methods than those used in the initial ranking.

#### Type: [[AI Transformers]]

### **How Reranking Works**

1. **Initial Ranking**:
    
    - Results are generated by a simple, computationally efficient model.
    - Example: A search engine ranks results using TF-IDF or a basic similarity metric.
2. **Feature Extraction**:
    - Additional features are computed for each result, such as semantic similarity, user behavior signals, or contextual relevance.
3. **Advanced Model**:
    - A more complex model (e.g., a neural network or learning-to-rank algorithm) reevaluates and reorders the results.
    - Common reranking models:
        - **BERT-based Models**: Used for reranking in NLP and search.
        - **Learning-to-Rank (LTR)**: Algorithms like RankNet, LambdaRank, or XGBoost-based LTR.
4. **Final Ranking**:
    - The reranked list is presented as the final output.

###### Where does this idea come from/Questions:
The idea of **reranking** originates from the broader fields of **[[information retrieval (IR)]]** and **[[Machine Learning]]**, where improving the quality and relevance of ranked results has been a persistent challenge.

###### What is similar to this idea:
The concept of **reranking** shares similarities with several other ideas and methods across various domains in AI, machine learning, and systems optimization. Here are some parallels:

- Learning-to-Rank
- Post-Processing in AI Pipelines
	- Reranking is essentially a form of **post-processing**, where an initial output (ranking) is refined using more sophisticated methods.
	- In **image recognition**, initial detections are refined using secondary models or rules (e.g., refining bounding box predictions in object detection).
- Multi-Stage Recommendation Systems
	- Recommendation systems often follow a **two-stage process**:
		- Candidate generation (fast, approximate filtering of items).
		- Candidate reranking (precise scoring of filtered items based on richer features).
	- Netflix recommends a broad set of movies and then reranks them using personalized metrics like watch history.
- Beam Search
	- In [[Natural Language Processing - NLP]], beam search generates multiple candidate sequences (e.g., translations or summaries) and selects the best one based on a scoring function, which is a form of reranking.
- Contextual Bandits
	- Reranking dynamically adjusts outputs based on **context** and **feedback**, similar to **contextual bandits**, which optimize decision-making by balancing exploration and exploitation.
	- Online ads: Ranking of ads is adjusted in real time based on user behavior.
- Ensemble Models
	- Reranking often combines multiple models or features to improve results, much like **ensemble methods** (e.g., random forests or stacking) aggregate predictions from multiple models.
	- Search engines combine signals from user behavior, content quality, and semantic similarity for reranking.
- Relevance Feedback
	- Both reranking and **relevance feedback** use additional signals to refine results.
	- In search engines, user actions like clicks or dwell time influence the ranking of future results.
- Data Augmentation in Model Training
	- Data augmentation refines a model's performance by adding diverse training examples, akin to how reranking improves output by incorporating additional context or features.

###### What is opposite of this idea:
The **opposite of reranking** would involve approaches that prioritize simplicity, static processing, or single-pass evaluation without iterative refinement or additional adjustments. Here are some ideas and methods that contrast with reranking:

- Single-Pass Ranking
	- Traditional search engines based purely on keyword matching (e.g., TF-IDF or BM25), where no additional layers of evaluation (like user feedback or contextual analysis) are applied.
- Static Ranking
	- Using predefined, fixed criteria to rank items without considering additional factors or feedback.
	- - - Hardcoded rankings in a leaderboard (e.g., top players sorted only by initial points, regardless of contextual performance).
- Deterministic Sorting
	-  Sorting items strictly based on one fixed metric (e.g., alphabetical order, price).
	- Sorting products in an e-commerce site by price, lowest to highest, without considering user preferences or relevance.
- No Refinement or Feedback
- Uniform Weighting
	- Treating all inputs or features equally without emphasizing certain aspects based on importance or relevance.
	- A scoring system that averages all attributes of items without weighting key features higher.
- One-Shot Predictions
	- Models or algorithms that generate a single prediction or output without considering alternate possibilities.
	- A text generator that outputs the first plausible sentence without comparing it to other candidates for relevance.
- First-Come, First-Served

- **Static Evaluation**: Results are determined without iteration or refinement.
- **No Context Awareness**: Outputs are independent of user behavior, feedback, or broader context.
- **Simplicity**: Prioritizes computational efficiency over quality or relevance.
- **Equal Treatment**: All items are treated uniformly, without emphasizing certain attributes or features.
