A short, amusing true story is an _anecdote_. You might come back from a crazy spring break with a lot of _anecdotes_ to tell.


The roots of _anecdote_ lie in the Greek word _anekdota_, meaning "unpublished." The word's original sense in English was "secret or private stories" — tales not fit for print, so to speak. It can still have connotations of unreliability, as in the phrase "anecdotal information." But the most common sense today is that of "a funny story about something that happened."
