The **Zettelkasten Method** distinguishes between **literature notes** and **permanent notes** based on their purpose, content, and how they are integrated into the system.

| **Feature** | **Literature Notes**                                                      | **Permanent Notes**                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose** | Summarize or capture ideas from specific sources (books, articles, etc.). | Develop standalone ideas that are independent of specific sources.               |
| **Content** | Direct quotations, summaries, and references from a source.               | Original thoughts, connections, and interpretations based on your understanding. |
| **Context** | Tied directly to the original source.                                     | Contextualized in your broader Zettelkasten network.                             |
| **Use**     | Temporary storage for raw material to generate permanent notes.           | Long-term knowledge that forms the core of your system.                          |
| **Example** | Notes from "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari summarizing a chapter.          | A standalone note connecting Harari's view on "shared myths" to modern branding. |

### **Examples**

#### **Literature Note Example**

**Title**: _Sapiens - Shared Myths (Chapter 2)_  
**Content**:

- "Shared myths enable large-scale cooperation among humans." (Harari, p. 27)
- Examples include religion, nation-states, and money.
- Key takeaway: Humans' ability to believe in abstract concepts is a significant evolutionary advantage.

---

#### **Permanent Note Example**

**Title**: _Shared Myths as Foundations for Cooperation_  
**Content**:

- Shared myths allow large groups of humans to cooperate effectively, transcending immediate kinship ties.
- Examples:
    - Religion: Creates moral frameworks and shared goals.
    - Nation-states: Foster collective identity.
    - Money: Functions as a trust mechanism based on collective belief.
- **Connection**:
    - Relates to the concept of "social trust" in economic theory.
    - Can be tied to branding in marketingâ€”brands function as modern "shared myths" for consumers.
- **Source**: Based on Harari's _Sapiens_ (p. 27), combined with personal reflections on marketing.
