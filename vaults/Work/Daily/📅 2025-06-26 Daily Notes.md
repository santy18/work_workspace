## Thoughts / Brain Dump
 i need to calm down. we have everything under control. I need to set up my ideas in a way that i can achieve it all.
main thing bothering me right now is that I dont know how to get someone to buy my product. so, what I am going to do is, when a purchase is completed, I will send a hit to our n8n server to let me know to add them to the app. that is it. I think that is how I am going to approach this. 

relax, think, and do.
