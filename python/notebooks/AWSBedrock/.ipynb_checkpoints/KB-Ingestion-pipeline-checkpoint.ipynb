    "\n",
    "OpenSearch is increasingly used as a vector database for LLMs due to its capabilities in handling and searching high-dimensional vector data. Here are the key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling High-Dimensional Vectors**:\n",
    "   - LLMs like 'amazon.titan-embed-text-v' transform textual data into high-dimensional vectors or embeddings, capturing semantic meanings numerically.\n",
    "   - OpenSearch efficiently stores and indexes these vectors, making it suitable for LLM outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vector Search Capabilities**:\n",
    "   - It supports vector search through the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) feature, essential for similarity searches.\n",
    "   - This is vital for applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and content discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scalability and Performance**:\n",
    "   - OpenSearch is designed for large datasets and offers horizontal scalability, a necessity for LLMs that generate large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexible Integration with Machine Learning Tools**:\n",
    "   - The platform can be easily integrated with various machine learning and data processing tools.\n",
    "   - This facilitates the direct pipelining of LLM outputs into the database for indexing and searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Real-Time Search and Analytics**:\n",
    "   - OpenSearch provides real-time search and analytics capabilities.\n",
    "   - Newly indexed vector data becomes immediately searchable, crucial for dynamic applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Community and Ecosystem Support**:\n",
    "   - As an open-source project, OpenSearch benefits from continuous improvements, including better vector data handling and machine learning model integrations.\n",

    "##  Create vector index\n",
    "\n",
    "This code snippet is designed to set up an OpenSearch index using the `opensearchpy` library in Python. It integrates with AWS services for authentication and index creation. Let's break down the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import Libraries and Setup Authentication**:\n",
    "   - `credentials = boto3.Session().get_credentials()`: Retrieves AWS credentials from the current session using `boto3`, an AWS SDK for Python.\n",
    "   - `awsauth = AWSV4SignerAuth(credentials, region_name, service)`: Initializes the AWS V4 signer authentication, which will be used to securely connect to OpenSearch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Index Name and Configuration**:\n",
    "   - `oss index`: \n",
    "An index in AMAZON Opensearch is a collection of documents with similar characteristics, akin to a database in a traditional relational database. It's defined by settings and mappings which specify its configuration, such as sharding and replication, and the schema for the data it stores, like data types and index-specific settings.\n",
    "   - `index_name = f\"bedrock-sample-index-{suffix}\"`: Sets the OSS index name with a unique suffix.\n",
    "   - `body_json`: Defines the JSON object for OSS index settings and mappings.\n",
    "       - `settings` with `\"index.knn\": \"true\"`: Enables KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) on the index for similarity search.\n",
    "       - `Why KNN`: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in OpenSearch configuration is used for similarity search, which is essential for applications requiring efficient and accurate retrieval of similar items from large datasets. By enabling KNN, OpenSearch can quickly find the \"nearest\" data points in a high-dimensional space, making it highly effective for tasks like recommendation systems, image search, and document retrieval, where the similarity between items is based on vector representations.\n",
    "       - `mappings`: Specifies the schema of the index.\n",
    "           - `vector`: A KNN vector field with a specified dimension (1536 in this case).\n",
    "           - `text`: A standard text field.\n",
    "           - `text-metadata`: Another text field for additional metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create OpenSearch Client**:\n",
    "   - `oss_client = OpenSearch(...)`: Creates an OpenSearch client instance.\n",
    "       - `hosts`: Specifies the OpenSearch cluster endpoint.\n",
    "       - `http_auth`: Sets the AWS authentication method.\n",
    "       - `use_ssl`, `verify_certs`: Ensures secure SSL communication.\n",
    "       - `connection_class`: Uses `RequestsHttpConnection` for making HTTP requests.\n",
    "       - `timeout`: Sets a timeout value for the client requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Allow Time for Data Access Rules Enforcement**:\n",
    "   - `time.sleep(60)`: Waits for 60 seconds. This delay ensures that any data access rules or permissions are fully propagated and enforced before any operations are performed on the index.\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is typically used in scenarios where you need to create an OpenSearch index for text and vector-based search, leveraging AWS for secure and scalable data handling.\n"

    "## Step 5 : Establishing Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base.\n",
    "This code configures various components for setting up a knowledge base with Amazon Bedrock and OpenSearch. Let's break down each part of the configuration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **OpenSearch Serverless Configuration**:\n",
    "   - `opensearchServerlessConfiguration`: This dictionary configures how the knowledge base will interact with an OpenSearch serverless instance.\n",
    "       - `collectionArn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the collection in OpenSearch. It is retrieved from the `createCollectionDetail` of the collection object.\n",
    "       - `vectorIndexName`: Name of the index in OpenSearch, specified by `index_name`.\n",
    "       - `fieldMapping`: Defines the mapping between the knowledge base fields and the OpenSearch fields. It includes the vector field for embeddings, a text field for textual data, and a metadata field.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chunking Strategy Configuration**:\n",
    "   - `chunkingStrategyConfiguration`: Specifies how the text data should be chunked before being processed.\n",
    "       - `chunkingStrategy`: The strategy used for chunking, set to `\"FIXED_SIZE\"` here.\n",
    "       - `fixedSizeChunkingConfiguration`: Configuration for the fixed-size chunking, including `maxTokens` (maximum number of tokens per chunk) and `overlapPercentage` (percentage of overlap between chunks).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **S3 Configuration**:\n",
    "   - `s3Configuration`: This configures the connection to an S3 bucket.\n",
    "       - `bucketArn`: The ARN for the S3 bucket, constructed using the `bucket_name`.\n",
    "       - `inclusionPrefixes`: (Commented out) If enabled, this allows filtering of data from S3 based on specific prefixes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Embedding Model Configuration**:\n",
    "   - `embeddingModelArn`: The ARN for the Amazon Bedrock embedding model, specifying the region and model name (`amazon.titan-embed-text-v1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Knowledge Base Details**:\n",
    "   - `name`: The name assigned to the knowledge base, appended with a unique `suffix`.\n",
    "   - `description`: A brief description of the knowledge base's purpose.\n",
    "   - `roleArn`: The ARN of the IAM role used by the knowledge base, stored in `bedrock_kb_execution_role_arn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this configuration sets up the necessary parameters for creating a knowledge base that leverages Amazon Bedrock for embeddings and OpenSearch for indexing and searching, with data sourced from an S3 bucket.\n"
