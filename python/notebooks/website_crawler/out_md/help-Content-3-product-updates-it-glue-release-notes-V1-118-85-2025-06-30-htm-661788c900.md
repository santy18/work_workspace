v1.118.88

# IT Glue V1.118.85: June 30, 2025

## Enhancement

The MyGlue extension now automatically fills in OTP codes for your passwords, saving you the hassle of retrieving them manually. You can also now disable autofill of login credentials on certain sites, enhancing security and managing exceptions. Simply open the inline menu and select the **Do not autofill for this webpage** check box.

## Fixes

* An issue that prevented users from adding an organization to the **Organization Access** list when the Lite user role was selected has been fixed.
* Accessing the matching page in Datto RMM no longer produces a 500 internal server error.
* An issue that prevented users from deleting contacts that were syncing with Datto SaaS Protection has been fixed.
* An issue that caused email alerts for offline data removal to be sent even when operating in offline mode has been fixed.
* A Network Glue error that occurred when Active Directory sync was enabled has been fixed.
* Documents generated by the SOP generator are no longer assigning the incorrect owner.
