v1.118.88

# IT Glue V1.118.4: March 31, 2023

## New Feature

**Enforced SSO Enhancements** - The following enhancements are made for the [Enforced SSO Access Control](../../1-admin/user-authentication/enforced-sso-access-control.html) feature:

* MyGlue and GlueConnect user limitations for Enforced SSO.
* When SSO is enabled and enforced, a new column **Enforced SSO Override** appears under **Account > Users > IT Glue**. It highlights those users who are only able to log in to IT Glue via direct authentication as a result of being added to the SSO exemption list.

## Fixed Issue

Fixed the issue when any modification to contacts via two-way sync removed suffixes of the contacts in Autotask.
