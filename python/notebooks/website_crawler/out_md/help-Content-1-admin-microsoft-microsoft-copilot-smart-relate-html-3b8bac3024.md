# Microsoft Integration: Copilot Smart Relate

BEFORE YOU BEGIN  To review prerequisites and learn how to fully set up an integration with Microsoft in IT Glue, refer to [Microsoft Integration](microsoft-integration.html).

Copilot Smart Relate, the AI engine of IT Glue, automatically links related documentation, saving you the hassle. To learn more, refer to [Cooper Copilot Smart Relate](../../2-using/get-to-know-it-glue/IT Glue Copilot Smart Relate.htm).

Through the integration with Microsoft Intune, Copilot automatically relates the Intune device (stored as an IT Glue configuration) with the assigned Microsoft 365 user (IT Glue contact).
