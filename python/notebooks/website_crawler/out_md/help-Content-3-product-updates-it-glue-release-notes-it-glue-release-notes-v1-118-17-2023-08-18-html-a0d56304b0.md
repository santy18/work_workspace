# IT Glue V1.118.17: August 18, 2023

## New feature

* Added an option to include or exclude archived assets from existing and new workflow rules. For more information, see *Configure the trigger* section in [Quick guide for workflows](../../1-admin/workflows/quick-guide-for-workflows.html).
* Administrators and Managers can now trigger a manual sync on [Integrating Datto SaaS Protection in IT Glue](../../1-admin/other-integrations/integrating-datto-saas-protection-in-it-glue.html) once every 6 hours. This is on top of the automatic sync, which occurs once every 24 hours.

Fixed the issue of partial failure of full organization manual and scheduled runbooks.
