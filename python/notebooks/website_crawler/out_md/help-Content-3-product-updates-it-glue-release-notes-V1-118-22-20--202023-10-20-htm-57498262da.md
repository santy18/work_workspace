v1.118.88

# IT Glue V1.118.22: October 20, 2023

## New features

* Introduced a new enhancement to setting up [Datto SaaS Protection](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/14725558955665-Integrating-Datto-SaaS-Protection-in-IT-Glue) integration. You can now securely reuse the Datto REST API credentials from the Datto BCDR integration (if your tenant already has one setup).
* Option in [Enforced SSO](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/10470056796689-Enforced-SSO-Access-Control) to allow specific users to use the override links to bypass SSO.

## Fixed Issues

* Fixed the issue where Microsoft Office online documents could not be opened if account has custom SSL branding and IP restrictions (IP Access Control)
* Fixed the 404 error page displayed when doing SSO via the IT Glue module in the KaseyaOne portal.
* Fixed the error 500 displayed when clicked on the Glue Connect tab.
* Fixed the issue where the user was not able to copy or move documents with GlueConnect.
