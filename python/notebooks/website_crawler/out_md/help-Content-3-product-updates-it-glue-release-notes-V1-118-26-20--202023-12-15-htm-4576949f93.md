## New features

[Wireless Auto-Documentation](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/19417377291153-Datto-Networking-Wireless-Network-Auto-Documentation) capabilities are now introduced in the Datto Networking integration where all SSID Networks with a WPA Personal/Pre-Shared Key will have a flexible asset record and associated password created under the Datto Networking Wireless flexible asset type.

Updated Modals/Dialogs across IT Glue. This work is to bring IT Glue in line with Kaseya's common look & feel initiative, as part of IT Complete.

Performance Optimizations: Updates were made to the IT Glue web app that will improve the speed and performance of the web app, reducing load times, and ensuring an overall smooth user experience.

## Resolved Issues

* Fixed the issue where workflow emails were not received.
* Fixed the issue where the scheduled account export always failed to complete.
* Fixed the issue of duplicate modules of IT Glue being created in KaseyaOne.
