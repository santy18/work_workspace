# IT Glue V1.118.70: February 13, 2025

## New features

* Added the ability to delete the **BitLocker Keys (via Network Glue)** folder and BitLocker Recovery Keys in IT Glue. See [Microsoft Integration: BitLocker recovery keys](../../2-using/documentation-guide/BitLocker_Keys.html) for more information.
* A new 2.8 build of the IT Glue Chrome Extension has been released. IT Glue chrome extension version 2.8 fixes issues that include session detection upon log in and log out, the content menu, and other issues.

## Bug fixes

This release fixed the following issues:

* Using the text box to create multiple headings in IT Glue documentation caused the position to be lost when opening the Table of Contents items in a new tab.
* Clicking "P" while viewing the password list or a specific password initiated a global password search instead of limiting it to the organization level.
* The document editor did not recognize a heading as a separate heading if a user copied a heading in the text section and pasted it in another text section.
* Inconsistent manufacturer and model sync of configuration when editing an existing product in Autotask.
* A broken link when users attempted to access Kaseya University through IT Glue help section.
* When an IT Glue user clicked **Log in with SSO** button on the mobile app, the IT Glue login page was displayed in a web browser instead of the KaseyaOne login page.
* Password assets did not load successfully within the matching tab.
