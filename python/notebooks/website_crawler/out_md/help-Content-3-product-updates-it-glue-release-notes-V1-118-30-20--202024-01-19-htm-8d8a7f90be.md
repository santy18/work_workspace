# IT Glue V1.118.30: January 19, 2024

## New features

* Create separate [password rotation](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/9298451537169-Active-Directory-Password-Rotation) rules for different organizations.
* SSO is now supported for [Offline Mode](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/10140815728529-Deployment-guide-for-offline-mode-sync-service-and-browser-extension).
* Admins can now quickly access the Datto BCDR DR Runbook feature from Organization Home page. This will only apply to Organizations that have been matched under the Datto BCDR integration.
* SSID information will now appear under the configuration show page for Datto Networking access points, as well as in the matching page.

## Resolved Issues

* Fixed minor issues with related items for the new Datto Networking Wireless Auto-Documentation feature.
* Fixed the issue where the records from the “Network“ column overlap the records from the “Username“ column on the **Account > Password Rotation** page.
* Fixed the issue in the **Password Rotation** page where the "All Matched Passwords" counter increased (even if no change was done) when opening the "Match Passwords" window.
* Fixed the issue where enabling or disabling "Enforced SSO Logins" toggle in the **Account > Authentication** tab disabled the "Offline SSO SAML SSO" toggle in the **Offline Mode** tab.
* Fixed alignment issues in the display of items in the Import a Flexible Asset Template list.
* Fixed the issue where MyGlue users could not be added in the NA and AU region.
